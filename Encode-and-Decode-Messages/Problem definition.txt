In this problem, you should create a JS functonality which encodes and decodes some
messages which travel to the network.

This program should contain two functionalities.
The first one is to encode the given message and send it to the receiver. 
The second one is to decode the received message and display it.

Encode: Change the ASCII CODE on every single character in that message when you add 1 to the current ASCII NUMBER,
that represent the current character in that message.
Decode: Subtract 1 from the current ASCII NUMBER, that represents the current character in that message.
