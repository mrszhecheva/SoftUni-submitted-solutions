Exercises: Defining Classes

Define a class Employee that holds the following information: name, salary, position, department, email and age.
Your task is to write a program which takes N lines of information about employees from the console
and calculates the department with the highest average salary and prints for each employee in that department
his name, salary, email and age - sorted by salary in descending order. If an employee doesn’t have an email –
in place of that field you should print "n/a" instead, if he doesn’t have an age – print "-1" instead.
The salary should be printed to two decimal places after the seperator.
